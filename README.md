Documemtation.

The was no feedback from my Lecture from my part 2, So I will talk about about my GUI application. So for things i change from my part 2 is the menu, because it was difficult to implement GUI with my part 2 menu, so the GUI has pushed me to make alot of changes in terms of the user to enter details, since the are new functions that i have to add too, e.g the user can filter the list of recipes and also choose a food group for the recipe/ingredient and sekect the maximum number of calories.
